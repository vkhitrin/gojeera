> This project is being worked on!

A **Text User Interface (TUI)** for interacting with Atlassian Jira directly from
your terminal.

## Introduction

**gojeera is a fork of <https://github.com/whyisdifficult/jiratui>.**

gojeera is built using the [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) and [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
frameworks.

It supports the [Jira Cloud Platform REST API v3](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/)
and [Jira Cloud Platform REST API v2](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/intro/) as well.

### Why Forking

- Continuous experimentation with the tool.
- Focus on Jira cloud instances.
- Breaking changes that can not be upstream easily.
